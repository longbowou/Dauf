## Architecture

The application architecture is split in two different parts: app(backend) for API and frontend for scripture
presentation.

### App (Backend With Nest Framework)

The backend of the application serves as the central component responsible for managing data, handling business logic,
and facilitating communication between the frontend interfaces and the database. Here's a breakdown of its key
components

- **Server**: Dauf utilizes the [Nest](https://docs.nestjs.com) framework for building scalable and maintainable
  server-side applications.
  Nest.js leverages TypeScript for strong typing and enhanced developer productivity, making it an ideal choice for
  complex applications like Dauf.

- **Scraping Functionality**: Nest facilitates the implementation of scraping functionality by providing a robust
  ecosystem
  of libraries and tools. The app leverages these capabilities to scrape entire Bible versions from websites such as
  bible.com, ensuring comprehensive access to Scripture for users.

- **GraphQL API**: Nest seamlessly integrates GraphQL into the backend, allowing developers to define schema structures
  and
  resolvers for accessing and manipulating data. Dauf's GraphQL API provides endpoints for fetching various Bible
  versions, enabling flexible and efficient data retrieval for frontend consumption.

- **Modular Architecture**: Nest promotes a modular architecture, organizing code into reusable and maintainable
  modules.
  This approach enables developers to efficiently manage the complexities of the scraping process and GraphQL API
  implementation, ensuring scalability and extensibility as the app grows.

- **Data Management**: Dauf's backend manages the scraped Bible data efficiently, storing it in
  a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/node/current) database. This
  ensures fast and reliable access to Bible versions for sermon display and retrieval.

### Frontend (Vue Framework)

The frontend interfaces for scripture presentation, controls and deep search. Here are the technical details

- **Framework**: Dauf's frontend is built using the [Vue](https://v2.vuejs.org/) framework, a progressive JavaScript
  framework known for its
  simplicity and versatility. Vue's component-based architecture facilitates the development of interactive and
  responsive
  user interfaces, crucial for Scripture presentation and user interaction.

- **API**: Dauf integrates the [Apollo](https://apollo.vuejs.org) library for GraphQL API integration on the frontend.
  Apollo simplifies the process
  of fetching and managing data from a GraphQL API, providing efficient caching mechanisms and powerful query
  capabilities. This integration enables seamless communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring real-time
  updates and smooth user experiences.

- **Scripture Presentation**: Vue components are utilized to create a dynamic and visually appealing interface for
  presenting Scripture on the big screen. Components such as slideshows, text displays, and navigation controls enable
  pastors and worship leaders to deliver impactful sermons and engage the congregation effectively.

- **State Management**: Utilize state management [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org) to manage application state, including
  saved scriptures details.

- **Responsive Design**: Dauf's frontend is designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring a consistent and optimized
  experience across devices of various screen sizes. Vue's flexible layout components and CSS
  frameworks [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction)
  enable the creation of fluid and adaptive user interfaces, enhancing accessibility and usability for all users.
